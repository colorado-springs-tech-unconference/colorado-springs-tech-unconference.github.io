                    <h2>Can I be a speaker? And how?</h2>
                    <p>Absolutely! We have a strong group of speakers already lined up, but the sooner we have firm commitments from enough speakers to fill the slots, the sooner we can start stressing about other things! If you want to be one of those speakers, send some information on yourself and the talk/presentation you would like to deliver to <a href="mailto:bparks@brianparks.me">this email address</a>.</p>

                    <h2>How can I sponsor?</h2>
                    <p>This year, we're asking sponsors to sponsor <em>things</em> (food, space, swag, etc.). In exchange, we'll talk you up before each of our keynotes, indicate the sponsor(s) of each <em>thing</em> when it becomes relevant (e.g. "and now, please enjoy lunch courtesy of <em>Your Name Here</em>!"), and include your logo on a slideshow played during each break. You're also more than welcome to attend (please <a href="https://ti.to/colorado-springs-tech-unconference/oct-12-2019/">sign up</a>) and talk yourself up.</p>
                    <p>Please <a href="mailto:bparks@brianparks.me">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
                    <p>If you're an individual and would like to contribute, or otherwise would like to sponsor but don't feel sponsoring a whole <em>thing</em> would be a good fit, please <a href="mailto:bparks@brianparks.me">contact us</a> and we will help you find a way to contribute!</a></p>

                    <h2>Who is Colorado Springs Tech?</h2>
                    <p>We started as a group of meetup organizers for some of the tech meetups in Colorado Springs, including <a href="https://meetup.com/coloradospringsjs">coloradosprings.js</a> and <a href="https://peakphp.org">PeakPHP</a>. We built a slack community for Colorado Springs (which you can also join <a href="http://www.colorado-springs-tech.org">here</a>). In 2019, we decided to further promote the Colorado Springs Tech community by organizing an (un)conference.</p>
